    <p>Second note of wisdom along with a color break between pics- Remove the distractions from your mind of politics, a big 
        news story or family issues & clear your mind so that it is not restricting your perspective or viewpoint</p>

        <p>3rd note of wisdom with color break- When your mind is silent it allows the light of your surroundings to enter 
            your inner apperture so that your can become aware of the environment. The more silent your mind the more light 
            you allow to enter your awareness(apperture)
