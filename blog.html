                <h3>Finding the Light in the Darkness</h3><br>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>I meditated in the garden this morning in the knowledge that birdies would generally not enter the garden to eat from the bird feed out of fear of humans in such close proximity. I decided to do test. I closed my eyes & gradually slipped into a calm stillness & opened briefly to peak at a family of sparrows sitting on the wall. They looked like they were considering if it was safe to go to the bird feed with a human just right beside their bird-feed. I began to take my concentration away from them again & focus my attention on my breath, when I opened my eyes, a family of sparrows were happily feeding beside me, allowing for the ideal opportunity to capture an image.</p>

                <p>Taking photographs and practising meditation might seem at first glance to be unrelated activities. Photography looks outwards at the visual world through the medium of a camera and meditation focuses inwards.<p> 
                <br>
                <p>Actually Meditation and photography have much in common, both are based in the present moment, both require complete focus, and both are most successful when the mind is free from distracting thoughts.</p> 
                <br>
                <p>With so many distractions in the world today meditation is a good way to escape from the downfall this can bring to your focus, awareness & attention.</p>
                <br>
                <p>For many people, photography serves as a form of meditation; a way to separate themselves from their stressful lives. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Both photography and meditation require an ability to focus steadily by stilling the mind allowing you to see more clearly. </p>
                <br>
                <p>A still camera will always catch the best shot, the same rule goes for the mind. End</p>
                <br>
                <p>While the meditator cultivates uninterrupted, non-judgemental awareness of the moment, the photographer captures the moment with a new perspective clear of distractions.</p> 
                <br>
                <p>While fully living in the moment you get a feeling for your surrounding & moments that would often escape your view begin to appear in your awareness.</p>  
                <br>
                <p>Finding focus & stillness inside before finding it on the camera can be very beneficial & creates a direct connection with you & your device</p>
                <br>
                <p>Intuition kicks in after quieting the mind. You can become more aware of your surroundings & begin to follow a intuitive hunch which you begin to trust. Now the magic begins to open up. Intuition is the key to catching a good photo, when I meditate & my awareness is free from obstruction, this is when I know the shot is good before I even check it on the back of the camera never mind the laptop when I get home.</p> 
                <br>
                <p>You gain an emotional reaction which fills you with a confidence that you have capture an expressive moment in the process of taking the picture. When you get home to review the images the image that sparked the most emotion is 99% of the time the one which rises above the rest in depth & 'appeal'.</p> 
                <br>
                <p>Releasing judgment, setting a mindful state, the scene will become your entire focus. Reduce expectations, being judgemental, be in the moment with no distractions. Sometimes you can't see the beauty in a moment when your mind is on other things like politics or latest news or family matters. (Like the image with the dandelion, perspective). Your perspective is wider ranging than the best & most expensive lengthy camera lens you can find. So making yourself a part of the camera lens your focus & aperture suddenly opens to what you are witnessing.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Through my journey in photography I have found that meditation has made a much bigger affect than I had expected & in a very positive way. Photography encourages mindfulness by heightening our awareness of what we see around us.
                <br>
                (after discussing blockages of perspective use the dandelion image to portray it!)</p>
                <br>
                <p>If you are not looking for it, chances are you won't see it' like birdies & removing yourself from instant gratification +distractions</p>
                <br>
                <p>An image of a item once focused on with a camera at a certain angle or witnessed in a certain depth of field, or captured in a light which illuminates it or adds shade can completely change the perspective of that item beyond recognition.
                <br>
                    (Slide show of images here of birds & wildlife? Or youtube video of images.. )</p> 
                <br>
                <p>If I have not meditated in a manner which brings my mind to a  state of silent stillness, I know from experience that I likely will not take a picture of any substance. When tired or with a lot on my mind I would take a walk with my camera & take snaps of beautifully scenery without any feeling of how the shot will look on my return home. I now acknowledge, that when I click that button that the image has a 99% chance having no substance, no depth. Although sometimes one can get lucky lucky.</p> 
                <br>
                <h4>“Your eye must see a composition or an expression that life itself offers you, and you must know with intuition when to click the camera.”– Henri Cartier-Bresson</h4>
                <br>
                <p>So when I walk out without setting my mind at ease & in stillness I am not able to truly see & therefore capture the true beauty that surrounds me. It's not that the beauty is not there, its mainly because I did not meditate to open my awareness to the possibilities. But that I am not open to witness & become aware of the true beauty of my surroundings each & everyone of us witness everyday. When I got into a deep meditation & leave with a silent mind I know I have a very high chance of finding a memorable capture. It is a feeling, an emotional connection you get with the photo & scene you are trying to capture when you click the button. That is when you know that when you sit down to review your images that the one that sparked to most emotion is the one that will stand out above all the rest.</p>
                <br>
                <p>You don' create a photo with your camera, you create it with your eyes, heart & your state of mind.</p>
                <br>
                <h4>“To photograph: it is to put on the same line of sight the head, the eye and the heart.” ― Henri Cartier-Bresson</h4>
                <br>
                <p>If you are not looking for it, chances are you won't see it, so opening your awareness & releasing blockages from your perspective is key.</p>
