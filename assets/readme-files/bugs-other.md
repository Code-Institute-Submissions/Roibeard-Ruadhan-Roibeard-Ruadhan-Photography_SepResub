-I began to realize that I was not the only one who used meditation to assist with photography as I began to build the direction for the website. My initial plan is to have a museum type atmosphere due to some creative complimentary ideas but on early use the design did not work aesthetically. 

-I used my ideas to source if it was viable/feasible to complete using CSS code & built my wireframe this.

-Originally I tried to turn my radio button in an image slider on the home page which worked but after doing further research I realised this was not a popular user experience. Aslo gitpod discouraged the use of -webkitappearance which was the foundation of this function.

-Used Angela Delise online assistance in completing my Responsive CSS grid.

-Removed underline from text by using information from stack overflow text-decoration : none;

-It felt necessary to add the final blog page. The website was missing a key component to bring the vision of the website into balance of functionality.

-I solved alot of my positioning problems through using inspect software device to play with removing and adding various properties. I found that removing properties often came up with the best results

The heading of the page was originally a museum wall of creative work went into building the hero image to set the atmosphere, using several different applications to edit & combine border, image plus museum wall.

I chose the colours by using coolors generating and uploaded the image to retract colours.

Navigation bar= back or top of a camera with buttons..

.my last wireframe plan didn't work, I couldn't find a colour balance to link the museum hero image in & the layout plan would not work with responsiveness to mobile. I see the radio button to flick through images but after reading it is not used I will likely drop that. Ideally when they click the image two arrows will come up either side to scroll but I think I need java script for that.

Decided to keep it minimalist & proffesional with some features like hamburger menu to make completely minimalist header, apart from my logo.

Changed the text to match the logo

I printed previously made an overlay with opacity. 5 to the navigation images on the home page but the overlay blocked from clicking, so instead of keeping the extremely long code, I added the writing to the image on a seperate application to make space on css. 80lines of code freed

-i found i wasn't been specific enough when i was trying to use thr dev tools to postion & shape my home page images. They were also targeting my logo image which gavemea fright but also explained a previous bug I couldn't solve so I restarted gitpod, lesson learned. It was a difficult yet rewarding lesson as when i find the solution on (s.website?) I realised I had learned a valuable lesson which would speed up my recovery time in future after I go through the process of fixing. I spent so much time fixing position, I decided its best to leave that till closer to the end, as when i add something new it affects the others.

-thank you to Speed Codez on YouTube for provoding code advice to change background image continously on intro page.
When i lost alot of my data during the incident on the 1st, it set me back a few dats trying to get my lost data back, now my assets are inside a 'source' file i drag & dropped into the file tree in the explorer after some correspondence with gitpod customer service

The project was initially going to be about Meditative Photography, which i only found out about after looking in to see if others had a similar experience to me. But I changed it to my home page to a photography + blog as the previous waas not sustainable over long-term. I have some experience in both areas & on the line that meets both is where i can offer the most experience intimate experience & advice. It was a true exoerience of not being able to take a picture without meditating in that day or expecially when tired.

Make sure to mention you edited the code for your own needs when mentioning being presented with code by somebody

A real struggle targeting the nav images on the home page.!!!

I copied the code for the hamburger from Erik Terwan of codepen.io but it was on the left side, so i found resolutions to change various aspects of the code by searching on stackoverflow!

Major problem. I had the images balance in 2 comlumns & 10 rows, which actually started as 20 rows. I had each image place in name boxes of 20, from 1a to 10b. I then struggled to find the right balance as some images were slightly larger than others. When I chose all the images that fit inline & nicely beside eachother it worked. But I knew it was not sustainable & if I wanted to add new pictures the grid would have to be transformed. So instead of seperating the 10 rows i decides to was more functional to just use the whole area (still deciding....). I found out by setting up a new name as the name aquamarine-termite, 

The images were too large & slowing down the web page & eating up unfortunate users monthly data in one click. I tried everything i could to stick with only using css & html, from using radio buttons to slide the images to shrinking the images unfortunately the website would not perform its main function well without the use of light box & a slight hint of Javascript.

Discussed solution with my Mentor after he advised me that the images have to be reduced dramatically. They started out at approximately 5-8mb each, i reduced them to 1-2mb but this was far away from where it needed to be. Felipe advised to check out gimp app platform for reducing image sizes dramatically(thumbnail size) & possibly use lightbox to link to the larger image.

It would have taken a very long time to source all the images again on my computer, which I previously had to do already) due gitpod crashing the day i added my images). But this time I figured I could download the complete repository from github & source tge images direct from there. Saving enormous time & tedious work. But now to scale each image individually to a thumbnail, which is a step by step, generally tedious process, which involves calculating the size of each image based on its role on the page. What size will the large image grow too px? How many images per page, therefore what size mb will each image be to not max out the page date etc

Optimized images are essential for seo & user experience as per the attached image on photography websites causing problems.

Fixed trouble with positioning of logo etc using justify' etc

Thanks to kasia i fixed the deploymemt issue & also helped resolve git pull issue after I edited readme.md via github repository.

As I could not find one background image that did not effect the visibility of the radio button query or forms. I had to remove the option of background translucency for the input form & add the <strong> attribute to the radio button query.
-hover over images in portfolio:reduce colour to start 80- then 100% when you hover which is a much more positive user friendly experience than the opposite which it was previously.

The introduction page works on all browzers but i was informed by a user that on firefox instead of transitioning it slides but is still effective. 

Thanks to the tutor team I resloved my button issue .

Contact form originally had translucency for the input area which I tried my best to make work but I couldn't find an image that would work with black or white colour text.
