            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                If I have not meditated in a manner which brings my my to a silent stillness, I know from eperience that I cannot take a picture of any substance
                or depth. When tired or with alot on my mind I would take a walk with my camera & take snaps of beautifully scenery without any 
                feeling of how the shot will look on my return home. I now aknowledge, that when I click that button that the image has a 99% chance having no substance, 
                no depth. Unless I get very lucky.  I So when I walk out without setting my mind at ease & in stillness I am not able to truly 
                see & therefore capture the true beauty that surrounds me. It'a not that the beauty 
                is not there, all because I did not meditate I would imagine. But that I am not open to witness & become aware of the true beauty of my
                surroundings each & everyone of us witness everyday. 

                When I got into a deep meditation & leave with a silent mind I know I have a very high chance of finding a beautiful capture. It is a feeling,
                an emotional connection you get with the photo & scene you are trying to capture when you click the button. That is when you know that when
                you sit down to review your images that the one that sparked to most emotion is the one that will stand out above all the rest.
