# Roibéard Ruadhán Photography

The purpose of this website is a way to share the benefits I have found with linking my two loves of meditation & most recently photography. It is a hybrid website with the mission to share my learnings of both photography & meditation, along with how they are both intertwined. I also get to share a portfolio of my most recent images which I will be updating over time. 
I am far from a professional in either area but when they are linked together I feel I can offer value through sharing my experiences of the complimentary benefits of meditation to photography & vice versa.

This website hopes to build on every aspect of the page after recently getting a new camera to capture more distinct images to constantly build on the foundation set. Also to try to add real value to anybody who enters the page by updating the Blog with relevant & hopefully inspiring information.

### UX Choices

### The Introductory page
The Introductory page was set up to develop an atmosphere of intrigue & somewhat excitement before entering the Home page.

If the user is coming in with an open perspective, a mood of deeper introspection of what to expect on entering, ideally this will bring more value to their visit.

### Home page
The Home page gives a glimpse at what is ahead with a minimalist modern design bringing more emphasis to the images.
This page leaves open options to navigate through the website via the more prescriptive Navigation images or the hamburger button on the top right of the screen.
#Carousel*?? 

### Nav bar
Due to the importance of setting the scene for the images, the Navbar is intentionally discrete, as the aim of the page is for a minimalist & professional atmosphere. The intention is to reduce the distractions on display when scrolling through the images. 
It is clearly visible on all pages in the top right corner & with the second option of the Nav images on the Home page.

### The logo 
I created the logo design using Adobe-Spark logo creator, which I found matched the character I was looking to create for the logo image.  
I wanted to keep the logo clear & unobtrusive so the images stand out above all.
I used the font in the image as the standard font for all the content to add consistency & a professional touch to catch the eye.

### The footer
Use of Font Awesome icons without text display a contemporary, minimalist platform for social links.
Added a direct link to my Instagram account to allow users to connect & to view other parts of my portfolio not on the website.

### Portfolio 
The 3-page portfolio is all contained within a plain white background which draws the user's attention to the images. The plain background also allows the images full expression without any external distractions.
****The images when clicked open up into a window for scanning through the images one by one using bootstrap.* TBC

The page menu was added for ease of access through the portfolio without interfering with the menu.
The colour of the menu is one of my favourite colours Cyan(colour of the ocean), which is the only other colour used on the website which is not a variant of black or white. 

### About
The About page gave me the opportunity to share what attracted me to photography & also share my love of wild-life & nature with images I have taken. 
Shares two images of me of one with my camera & another capturing the sun over the Himalayas from my travels.

### Blog
The blog page is where I get the opportunity to share my learnings from my experience of using meditation to enhance my enjoyment of photography & vice versa.
### Contact
Contains a minimalist submission form that also uses the radio button to query the users' photography interests.
The background image's intention is to set a welcoming atmosphere to invite users to get in contact.
