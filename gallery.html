            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                If I have not had a deep meditation I cannot take a picture of any depth or substance. When tired I could take a walk with my camera 
                in the knowledge,that when I click that button that the image 90% have no substance, no depth. I So when I walk out without setting my
                mind at ease & in stillness I am not able to truly see & therefore capture the true beauty that surrounds me. It'a not that tbe beauty 
                is not there all because I did not meditate, I would imagine but that I am not open to witness & become aware of the true beauty that
                surrounds each & everyone of us everyday.
