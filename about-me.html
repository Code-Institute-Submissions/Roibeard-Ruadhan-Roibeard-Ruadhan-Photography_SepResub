                <p>I love to travel, I guess this is where my love for photography originated. Travelling & absorbing the intricacies of diverse cultures is a passion of mine. Embracing the diversity over a reasonable period of time evolve in my view from "This is Extremely Strange"to “Of course this is normal!” is a mind opening process. Therefore capturing this on an image is saving that moment in a capsule of time? (image abroad + nepal)</p>
                <br> 
                <p>I try to emphasise the power of nature in my images & to show no matter how much we manage to mess it up, nature has got it all under control. (flowers growing out of wall)</p>
                <br> 
                <p> I like to take random photo's when something catches my attention (random image). I paricular enjoy watching the birds go about there day to day routines, to try to learn the different attributes & characteristics about a variety of distnguished bird familys. I strive to be in nature in nature as much as possible, as the great Leonardo da vinci would say <br>
                    <strong>“Nature is the source of all true knowledge. She has her own logic, her own laws, she has no effect without cause nor invention without necessity.” <br> “The wisest & nobelist teacher is nature itself.”</strong>*(bird images)</p>
                <br> 
                <p>I am in many ways I am what is called a late bloomer, it may have taken time to find my passions but I learned so much from a variety of perspectives along the path to finding them.</p>
                <br> 
                <p>Extremely interested in technology & the endless opportunities left to create anew. I only buy presents that will bring long term value to some ones life, it must have an uplifting use case, preferably long-term benifits. </p>
                <br> 
                <p>I realised for me to take a good photo, I need to quieten those the mind of “I Have to do this, I Have to do that” & to clear any blockages from awareness making for a clean unhindered perspective to view the world from. (image of dandelion) I do this through meditation, generally in the early morning. Meditation also helps with living in the moment & photography in many ways is trying to capture a fleeting moment in time. Which to be seen properly it may be necessary to wipe clean a stained glass view.</p>
                <br> 
                <p>I was particularly drawn to photography when I stepped away from the television. No more sad news & advertisements to distract me from the beauty that surrounds me. Too many sunrises & sunsets missed catching up on ""Lost"".  So I decided to buy a camera to share what I was witnessing""" outside my window??"".</p>
                <br> 
                (Use the ducks image to portray what you are witnessing & explaining on it through the use of a mirror)
                <br> 
                <p>I love to look around me & find the beauty in nature, by finding a different perspective, focusing on it without distractions, this can open your viewpoint to its true beauty (images of flowers/birds)</p>
                <br> 
                <p>I guess my mission from the beginning was to put a sharp focus on the beauty of the world in times when there are so many distractions to deviate your perspective? from truly seeing. To shine a light on the incredible ever changing world that surrounds us, away from the media to the artist that is nature??</p>
                <br> 
                <p>I am self trained photographer, who tries to capture the beauty of passing moments. It's like finding light in a dark place, if you are not looking for it, you may not find it. </p>
