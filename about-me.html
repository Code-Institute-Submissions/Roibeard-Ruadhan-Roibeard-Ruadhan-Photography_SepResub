                <p>I love to travel, I guess my love for photography came from this. Travelling & absorbing the intricacies of diverse cultures is a passion of mine. Embracing the the diversity over a reasonable period of time until they go from extremely strange to “of course this is normal!” is a mind opening process. Therefore capturing this on an image is saving that moment in a capsule of time? (image abroad + nepal)</p>
                <br> 
                <p>I try to emphasise the power of nature in my images & to show no matter how much we manage to mess it up its got it all under control. (flowers growing out of wall)</p>
                <br> 
                <p> I like to take random photo's when something catches my attention (random image) I love to watch the birds, learn different attributes about each different bird as I watch them. I also love to be in nature, like Leonardo da vinci would say “Nature is the source of all true knowledge. She has her own logic, her own laws, she has no effect without cause nor invention without necessity.” - “The wisest & nobelist teacher is nature itself.”*(bird images)</p>
                <br> 
                <p>I really feel like a late bloomer, it may have taken time to find my passions but I learned a lot on the path to finding them.</p>
                <br> 
                <p>Interested in technology & “the importunities to leaves to create which is a passion of mine?”. I only buy presents that will bring long term value to some ones life, it must have an uplifting use case, preferably long-term. </p>
                <br> 
                <p>I realised for me to take good photos I need to quieten those thoughts of “Have to do this, have to do that” & clear any blockages of awareness or perspective. (image of dandelion) I do this through meditation, generally in the morning. Meditation also helps with living in the moment & photography in many ways is trying to capture a fleeting moment in time.</p>
                <br> 
                <p>I really got into photography when I first stopped watching tv. No more sad news & advertisements to distract me from the beauty that surrounds me. So I decided to buy a camera to share what I was witnessing which I felt was more important.</p>
                <br> 
                (Use the ducks image to portray what you are witnessing & explaining on it through the use of a mirror)
                <br> 
                <p>I love to look around me & find the beauty in nature, by finding a different perspective, focusing on it without distractions, this can open your viewpoint to its true beauty (images of flowers/birds)</p>
                <br> 
                <p>I guess my mission from the beginning was to put a sharp focus on the beauty of the world in times when there are so many distractions to deviate your view/perspective from truly seeing. To shine a light on the incredible ever changing world that surrounds us, particularly in times of so much distraction.</p>
                <br> 
                <p>I am self trained photographer, who tries to capture the beauty of passing moments. It's like finding light in a dark place, if you are not looking for it, you may not find it. </p>
